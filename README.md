Pluton, Your Crypto Friend ü§ñüìà

Welcome to the Pluton, Your Crypto Friend repository! üëã This project is the culmination of my final course work, where I developed a simple desktop application to display the real-time price of major cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin (BTC/USDT), by integrating with the Binance API.

Pluton serves as a practical example of how to consume external APIs to obtain dynamic data and present it in a basic graphical user interface.

Project Goal üéØ
The main objective of this course-closing project was:

- API Integration: Establish a connection and consume real-time data from the public Binance API.
- Data Visualization: Clearly display the current Bitcoin price in a graphical interface.
- GUI Development: Build an interactive desktop application using tkinter.
- Basic Error Handling: Implement exception management for issues when fetching data.

Key Features ‚ú®
- Real-time Bitcoin Price: Fetches and displays the current BTC/USDT price directly from Binance.
- Simple Graphical Interface: An intuitive desktop window for quick viewing.
- Manual Update: A button to refresh the price on demand.
- Exit Functionality: A button to cleanly close the application.

Technologies Used üíª
- Python: The main programming language.
- python-binance: A Python client library for easy interaction with the Binance API.
- tkinter: Python's standard library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

Installation and Execution ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To get Pluton up and running on your machine:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/wfmendez/pluton_bot_trading.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd pluton_bot_trading
Install the necessary dependencies:

Bash

pip install python-binance
(Make sure you have pip installed and Python configured in your environment.)

Run the program:

Bash

python pluton.py
Important Note: The code includes example API_KEY and SECRET. For real use, you should replace these with your own Binance API keys and ensure you handle them securely (e.g., using environment variables) and never upload them directly to a public repository.

Lessons Learned üß†
This project was crucial for understanding:

Third-party API integration and handling JSON data.
The development of basic GUI applications with tkinter.
Fundamental concepts of networking and HTTP request handling in Python.
The importance of secure credential management in real-world projects.
